Here is the pseudocode for this video player program.


Step 01: Create a HTML, CSS and Javascript file.
Step 02: Link CSS & Js file with HTML file. 
Step 03: Use video element with Source of the video in html file. 
Step 04: Make appropriate design for the player in CSS file. 
Step 05: Create individual function for each task in .js file
Step 06: Connect event listener in .js file


Design Pattern: 

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to accomplish this task.  

The first step to getting video element on the page is rendering one using the video tag. I needed a variety of controls to manipulate certain parts of the video element's API. Within each video element there are a huge amount of properties we can access with JavaScript to manipulate.

The HTML above contains
* a .player div which I used for styling is CSS. 
* a video element with a src attribute referenced
* a .player-controls div of which had all the controls I wanted to add.
* a .button div for wrapping the play/pause icons we'll make use of
* buttons for skipping ahead and backward

My JavaScript code focused on an object-oriented approach. These controls and elements manipulated JavaScript and deal with user interaction on event listeners to do the task.
